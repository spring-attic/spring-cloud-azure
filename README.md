# spring-cloud-azure

This project lists the ongoing efforts being worked on in conjunction with Microsoft
to integrate Spring applications with Azure Cloud Services.  It hosts the gh-pages branch
that provides the content for https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-azure/.

This project will not host source code directly, but provides a convenient jumping off
point into the Microsoft repositories that provide code that support Spring applications:

- https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-spring-boot

  Starters/Autoconfiguration for Azure managed services (e.g. Azure Active directory, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage)

- https://github.com/Microsoft/spring-data-cosmosdb

  Access data with Azure Cosmos DB

- https://github.com/Microsoft/spring-data-gremlin

  Access data with any Gremlin-compatible data store, and also with Azure Cosmos DB

- https://github.com/Microsoft/spring-cloud-azure/

  Seamless Spring Cloud integration with Azure managed services (e.g. Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus)
