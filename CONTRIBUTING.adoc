= Code formatting guidelines

The directory src/eclipse has two files for use with code formatting, `eclipse-code-formatter.xml`
for the majority of the code formatting rules and `eclipse.importorder` to order the import
statements.

== Eclipse
Import these files by navigating `Windows -> Preferences` and then the menu items
`Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter` and `Preferences > Java > Code Style >
Organize Imports` respectively.

== IntelliJ IDEA
Install the plugin `Eclipse Code Formatter`. You can find it by searching in "Browse Repositories",
under `Settings > Plugins` within IDEA (Once installed, you will need to reboot IDEA for it to take
effect).

Then navigate to `Settings > Other Settings` (this might be under `Preferences` on Mac) and select
the Eclipse Code Formatter.
Select the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file for the field `Eclipse Java Formatter config file` and
the file `eclipse.importorder` for the field `Import order`.
Enable the `Eclipse code formatter` by clicking `Use the Eclipse code formatter` radio button at the
top of the page, then click the *OK* button.

* NOTE: If you configure the `Eclipse Code Formatter` from `File > Other Settings > Default
Settings`, it will set this policy across all of your IDEA projects.

* IDEA's "Optimize imports on the fly" option turned on interferes with the Eclipse code formatter
import optimization. Consider disabling the option if optimization does not yield the expected
results.

2. A repository owner will respond to your issue as soon as possible

3. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a
https://cla.pivotal.io/[Contributor License Agreement]

4. Fork the repository, develop and test your code changes

5. Ensure that your code adheres to the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style[Spring Style
Guide]

6. Ensure your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass

7. If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).

8. Submit a pull request. It will be approved and merged by a committer

== Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project).
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).
